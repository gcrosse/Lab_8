Lab 8 Objectives:
>  Work with JavaScript objects, JSON, destructuring, and the spread operator.
>  Add and use object methods to handle data dynamically.

Setup:
>  Create files: index.html, script.js, and styles.css (optional).
>   Initialize a local Git repo, create one on GitHub, and link them.

Instructions:
>  Part 1: Create a Student Object
        >  Define a student object with name, age, enrolled, and courses.
        >  Add a method to display student info and log name, age, and method output.

>  Part 2: JSON Operations
        >  Convert the student object to a JSON string and log it.
        >  Convert the JSON string back to an object and compare it to the original.

>  Part 3: Destructuring
        >  Destructure name and courses from the student object.
        >  Create an array of scores and destructure the first two scores to log them.
>  Part 4: Spread Operator
        >  Clone the student object and add a graduationYear property to the clone.
        >  Use the spread operator to merge student.courses with a new array of courses.

>  Part 5: Object Methods
        >  Add a method to add a new course to the courses array.
        >  Add a method to return the total number of courses.

Bonus:
>  Use reduce to calculate the average score from the scores array.
